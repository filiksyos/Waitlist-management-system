# Clinic Waitlist Management Project Overview

This project is a simple clinic waitlist management system designed for real-time queue updates across three roles:

- **Receptionist:** Creates a patient entry on their desktop, which instantly updates the queue for both the doctor and the public display.
- **Doctor:** Sees the real-time queue on their desktop. When finished with a patient, clicks 'remove' to update the queue for all parties.
- **Queue Display (Big Screen):** Shows only patient names and their place in the queue for waiting patients in the clinic.

**Key Behaviors:**
- When a patient is created, their info is sent simultaneously to the doctor's queue and the public queue display.
- When a patient is removed by the doctor, the queue updates in real time for both the doctor and the public display, popping the next patient to the top.

**Guiding Principle:**
- The app prioritizes core functionality and real-time updates with the simplest possible implementation. UI and database complexity are minimizedâ€”if the core workflow works, the solution is sufficient.
